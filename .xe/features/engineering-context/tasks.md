**Input**: Design documents from `.xe/features/engineering-context/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, spec.md

## Step 1: Setup

None

## Step 2: Tests First (TDD)

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

Not applicable - this is a template feature with manual validation rather than automated tests.

## Step 3: Core Implementation

- [ ] T001: Create architecture.md template per FR-1
- [ ] T002: Create engineering.md template per FR-2
- [ ] T003: Create development.md template per FR-3

## Step 4: Integration

None

## Step 5: Polish

- [ ] T004: Validate architecture.md meets FR-1 requirements
- [ ] T005: Validate engineering.md meets FR-2 requirements
- [ ] T006: Validate development.md meets FR-3 requirements
