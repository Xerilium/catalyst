# Tasks: Engineering Context Templates

**Input**: Design documents from `.xe/features/engineering-context/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, spec.md

## Step 1: Setup

- [ ] T001: Read `.xe/standards/catalyst.md` to understand template conventions

## Step 2: Tests First (TDD)

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

Not applicable - this is a template feature with manual validation rather than automated tests.

## Step 3: Core Implementation

- [ ] T002: Create architecture.md template per FR-1
- [ ] T003: Create engineering.md template per FR-2
- [ ] T004: Create development.md template per FR-3

## Step 4: Integration

Not applicable - templates are standalone files with no integration dependencies.

## Step 5: Validation

- [ ] T005: Validate architecture.md meets FR-1 requirements
- [ ] T006: Validate engineering.md meets FR-2 requirements
- [ ] T007: Validate development.md meets FR-3 requirements
