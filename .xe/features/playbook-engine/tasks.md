  - Implement PlaybookAction<VarConfig> interface
  - Primary property: `name` (support `var: variable-name` shorthand)
  - Config validation:
    - Name must be kebab-case format
    - Name must not be reserved word (check reserved list: 'primary', 'step', 'action', 'config', etc.)
  - Privileged access: Accept PlaybookContext as constructor parameter (injected by Engine)
  - Execute logic:
    - Retrieve interpolated value from config.value (already interpolated by Engine before action.execute())
    - Directly mutate context.variables[name] = value
    - Return success result with no outputs
  - Error handling: Throw CatalystError with code 'InvalidVariableName' if validation fails

  - Implement PlaybookAction<ReturnConfig> interface
  - Primary property: `code` (support `return: SuccessCode` shorthand)

    - Use ValidatorFactory from playbook-definition for schema validation
  - Privileged access: Accept PlaybookContext as constructor parameter
  - Execute logic:
    - Set special flag in context to signal early termination: `context.earlyReturn = { code, message, outputs }`
    - Return success result with outputs
  - Engine integration (implement in Engine):
    - After each step execution, check if context.earlyReturn is set
    - If set, halt execution loop
