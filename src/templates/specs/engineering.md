# Engineering Principles for {project-name}

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Define engineering principles and standards. Keep to core principles that guide AI and human development. Remove any principles that don't fit {project-name}.

## Core Principles

- **KISS**: Simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones, avoid premature optimization
- **YAGNI**: Build only what is needed, avoid implementing features "just in case"
- **Separation of Concerns**: Logic organized by purpose, components have single responsibilities
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles exactly one well-defined function
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification via configuration and composition
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Principle of Least Astonishment**: Behavior matches user expectations, consistent patterns
- **DRY**: Single source of truth, no duplication of logic or configuration
- **Fail Fast**: Detect and report errors immediately with clear, actionable messages
- **Design for Testability**: Easy to test and validate, comprehensive coverage
- **Deterministic Processing**: Consistent, predictable output for identical inputs

## Technical Standards

See `.xe/standards/` for language-specific coding standards and conventions.

See `.xe/process/development.md` for the complete development workflow and implementation process.
