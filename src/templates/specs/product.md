# Product Vision

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Define the product vision and strategic direction. Keep concise—focus on what AI needs to guide implementation decisions.

## System Overview

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> 2-3 sentences: what the project does, core value proposition, primary user benefits.

## Product Strategy

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> List strategic priorities that guide feature sequencing and trade-off decisions.

1. Prove the concept works (POC)
2. Perfect the user experience (Mainstream)
3. Deliver breakthrough capability (Innovation)
4. Build extensible foundation (Platform)
5. Enterprise readiness (Enterprise)
6. Scale to broader markets (Scale)

## Design Principles

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> 3-5 non-negotiable values guiding all implementation decisions. Each principle must:
> - Be memorable and directive (declarative statements)
> - Reflect clear value/tradeoff that guides decisions
> - Be actionable and opinionated across use cases
> - Avoid generic phrases that don't guide decisions
>
> Format: **Title: Directive statement**
> Rationale: 1-3 sentences clarifying when it applies, what it enables/constrains.
>
> Examples:
> - **Transparent: Work in the open** - Think and act in the open. All work is traceable by default, reversible by design. Every decision must be auditable.
> - **Accountable: Enforce strategic coherence** - Proactively seek oversight at checkpoints. Never hide logic or bypass control.

## Non-Goals

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> What this product will NOT do. Prevents scope creep. 2-3 items focusing on boundaries.
