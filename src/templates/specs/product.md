# {project-name} Product Context

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> This document defines product vision, strategy, target personas, high-level scenarios, design principles, technical requirements, success metrics, and team structure. Replace all `{placeholder}` values and complete each section following the guidance provided. Remove instruction blocks after completion.

## System Overview

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> 2-3 sentence overview of {project-name}: core value proposition and user benefits.

## Product Strategy

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Document the phased implementation approach with priorities for each phase. Describe what capabilities are delivered in each phase and why that sequencing makes sense. Use bullet points or numbered phases (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.).

## Target Personas

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Define 2-4 key user archetypes with their goals, needs, and pain points. For each persona, include:
> - Name and role
> - Primary goals
> - Key needs
> - Current pain points

### {Persona-Name-1}

**Role**: {role-description}
**Goals**: {primary-goals}
**Needs**: {key-needs}
**Pain Points**: {current-pain-points}

### {Persona-Name-2}

**Role**: {role-description}
**Goals**: {primary-goals}
**Needs**: {key-needs}
**Pain Points**: {current-pain-points}

## High-Level Scenarios

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Describe 3-5 key user workflows showing how personas accomplish important outcomes. For each scenario:
> - Persona + goal
> - Key steps (high-level, not detailed UI)
> - Expected outcome

### Scenario 1: {Scenario-Name}

**Persona**: {persona-name}
**Goal**: {user-goal}

**Steps**:
1. {step-1}
2. {step-2}
3. {step-3}

**Outcome**: {expected-outcome}

### Scenario 2: {Scenario-Name}

**Persona**: {persona-name}
**Goal**: {user-goal}

**Steps**:
1. {step-1}
2. {step-2}
3. {step-3}

**Outcome**: {expected-outcome}

## Design Principles

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Define 3-5 product-wide values that guide feature decisions. Each principle should have:
> - Name (one word or short phrase)
> - Description (1-2 sentences explaining what it means and why it matters)
>
> Examples: Transparent, Autonomous, Collaborative, Simple, Fast, Secure

- **{Principle-1}**: {description}
- **{Principle-2}**: {description}
- **{Principle-3}**: {description}

## Technical Requirements

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Document platform, integration, performance, and scalability requirements. Include:
> - Target platforms (web, mobile, desktop, CLI)
> - Required integrations (APIs, services, tools)
> - Performance targets (response time, throughput)
> - Scale requirements (users, data volume, geographic distribution)

**Platform**: {target-platforms}

**Integrations**: {required-integrations}

**Performance**: {performance-targets}

**Scale**: {scale-requirements}

## Success Metrics

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Define measurable outcomes across adoption, performance, and quality dimensions. Use specific, measurable targets.
>
> Examples:
> - Adoption: Daily active users, feature usage rate, conversion rate
> - Performance: Response time, throughput, uptime
> - Quality: Error rate, customer satisfaction, task completion rate

**Adoption**:
- {metric-1}: {target}
- {metric-2}: {target}

**Performance**:
- {metric-1}: {target}
- {metric-2}: {target}

**Quality**:
- {metric-1}: {target}
- {metric-2}: {target}

## Non-Goals

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Explicitly document what this product will NOT do. This clarifies scope boundaries and prevents feature creep.
>
> Examples:
> - Support for legacy platform X
> - Real-time collaboration features
> - Mobile native apps (web-only for v1)

- {non-goal-1}
- {non-goal-2}
- {non-goal-3}

## Team

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Document team roles and responsibilities. Include product manager, architect, lead engineer, and AI reviewer.

**Roles**:

- **Product Manager**: {product-manager}
- **Architect**: {architect}
- **Engineer**: {engineer}
- **AI Reviewer**: {ai-reviewer}
