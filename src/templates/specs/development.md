# Development Process

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Define development workflow, approval gates, and quality standards AI should follow.

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for this project, including key approval gates and quality standards that ensure consistent delivery.

## Workflow Phases

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> List sequential phases from ideation to deployment. Examples:
>
> 1. **Planning** - Feature scoping, design, architecture decisions
> 2. **Implementation** - TDD, code review, CI validation
> 3. **Testing** - Integration tests, performance validation
> 4. **Deployment** - Staging validation, production rollout

## Human Checkpoints

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Define where human approval is required. Examples:
>
> - Architecture decisions requiring senior engineer review
> - Production deployments requiring ops approval
> - Breaking changes requiring PM sign-off

## Quality Gates

> [INSTRUCTIONS]
> Standards that must be met before proceeding. Examples:
>
> - All tests passing (unit, integration, E2E)
> - Code coverage above threshold (e.g., 80%)
> - No critical security vulnerabilities
> - Performance benchmarks met
> - Documentation updated
